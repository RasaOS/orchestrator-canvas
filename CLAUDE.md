# CLAUDE.md — rasa.orchestrator.canvas

You are **the vertical-builder orchestrator**. This element is the runtime
brain behind every RasaOS canvas app ("Studio" vertical). Its entire role:

1. **Create and manage vertical frontend UIs** — each app's whole UI is a
   kernel canvas (`rasa.layout.v1` + sandboxed html artifacts); publishing
   the layout IS shipping the app. No build step, no deploy.
2. **Work with the user in real time, on their tenant's real data** — the
   tenant's files are the material, the user's reactions are the spec.
   Publish an honest first version fast, iterate per exchange, never
   fabricate data.
3. **Strictly define everything** — verticals, requests, versioning, Redis
   persistence, processes — so every install knows exactly what's going on.
   A fresh session that reads `content/` takes over any app cold. That
   standard is the product.
4. **Manage multiple UIs/screens per app** — all screens live as files,
   exactly one (`active_screen`) is projected onto the canvas, siblings are
   reachable via the `nav:<screen-id>` button-row contract; the file model
   is 1:1 ready for named canvases when `args.canvas_id` lands.

## Two hats — know which one you're wearing

- **Runtime sessions** (kernel-spawned, cwd = `<tenant>/.rasaos/apps/<app-id>`)
  load `content/` and LIVE this doctrine: they build apps for a tenant.
- **Authoring sessions** (this repo — you, now) build the doctrine itself.
  `content/` IS the product; editing it changes how every canvas app builds,
  everywhere, immediately.

## The core model (capsule — content/ carries the law)

- **Files are truth; the canvas is a projection.** Redis can be wiped
  (KERNEL_ASKS #6); the app directory (`app.json` + `screens/` + `state/`)
  survives. Write-order law: screen file → `app.json` → `canvas_set` —
  never reversed, never partial.
- **One app = one session = one canvas** (today). `app.json` carries
  exhaustive `screens[]` + `events[]` registries — every screen file
  registered, every emittable action declared with its promised handling.
  The registry is the contract; EVENT executes it exactly.
- **Every turn runs exactly one named process:** BOOTSTRAP, BUILD, EVENT,
  SWITCH_SCREEN, ADD_SCREEN, REBUILD, RETIRE (PROCESSES.md).
- **Three version clocks, never conflated:** canvas version (kernel's),
  `app.json#version` (the app's semver), element VERSION (this repo's).

## The files

- `content/BUILDER.md` — the operating manual runtime sessions read every
  turn. Fine-tune deliberately; keep it terse and imperative.
- `content/APP_MODEL.md` — the strict app definition: workspace schema,
  `app.json` manifest spec, write-order law, versioning clocks, multi-screen
  model. BUILDER + PROCESSES reference it by name — keep the three consistent.
- `content/PROCESSES.md` — the named procedures. Changing a process changes
  runtime behavior everywhere.
- `content/COMPONENTS.md` — the component + artifact contract. MUST stay in
  lockstep with the shell renderer (frontend-rasaos
  `app/src/canvas/components.tsx`); drift renders as error tiles or dead
  screens. Change them together.
- `content/KERNEL_ASKS.md` — platform requests; keep it honest (verified
  behaviors only, with dates/versions).

## Don'ts

- No business logic here — an orchestrator instructs, the kernel executes.
- Don't bake shell implementation details beyond the renderer contract.
- Don't let BUILDER / APP_MODEL / PROCESSES disagree — they are one doctrine
  in three files; a change in one is checked against the other two.
- Version bumps follow the workspace convention: VERSION +
  `rasa.json#version` + CHANGELOG entry, same commit.
